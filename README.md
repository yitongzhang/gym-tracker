**Workout tracking**
1. Create a workout
2. Create an exercise by choosing from a list, and add it to my workout
3. Log sets for each exercise. Every set is composed of a number of reps at a certain weight.
4. When I finish as set, automatically run a rest time countdown timer
4. Visualize my workout history on a calendar

**Data vizualiation**
1. Show a calendar in month view that visualizes every day I worked out
2. After I choose an exercise, show what my numbers were the last three times i did this exercise.

## Data structure
* A workout is a collection of exercises
* Every exercise has: name, description, suggested rest time between sets, tracks the number of instances i've done, and a max weight.
* Every instance of an exercise has: how many sets I did, how many reps per set, what weight I used for each set,
